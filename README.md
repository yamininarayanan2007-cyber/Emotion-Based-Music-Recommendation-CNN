# Emotion-Based-Music-Recommendation-CNN
Developed an Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for facial emotion recognition. Implemented real-time emotion detection using OpenCV and recommended mood-based music through a Flask web application. Improved user experience by integrating deep learning-based classification with dynamic song mapping.
